Compiling libtrace3 for WIN32
=============================

libtrace3 provides a MSVC build environment to allow you to compile and run
the code in a Windows environment.

There has been no extensive testing yet. Some of the format modules may be
broken. There may be dragons here.

Visual Studio 2005 or greater is required. Development has been performed
using MS Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition. 

You will also need a correctly installed copy of the Platform SDK. The
Windows Server 2003 SP1 SDK was used for Development.

To build libtrace using Visual Studio open the provided solution 
'libtrace.sln' this solution contains three projects:

* libtrace.vcproj       - The actual library, builds a DLL
* test-format.vcproj    - Builds the test-format executable from test/
* test-convert.vcproj   - Builds the test-convert executable from test/

Before you compile libtrace you will need to copy config-win.h to config.h
in the top level directory. There is currently no integration with autoconf
or any of the standard GNU build tools.

From the build menu select 'Build Solution'. After the build has completed
sucessfully execute the test-format and test-convert programs with the 
following parameters

 test-format erf
 test-format wtf
 test-format pcapfile

 test-convert erf erf
 test-convert pcapfile erf

As each program completes it should output 'success: 100 packets read'. If
this string is not displayed there is a problem and debugging will be 
required.

The above invocations of test-format and test-convert are known to work in 
the development environment. Other combinations of formats are not supported
at this time.
