   dealing with is essentially a directed graph.  If we find an item
   that is part of a graph that contains a cycle we traverse the graph
   in backwards direction.  In general there is no unique way to do
   this, but that is no problem.  If we encounter an item that we have
   encountered before, we know that we've found a cycle.  All we have
   to do now is retrace our steps, printing out the items until we
   encounter that item again.  (This is not necessarily the item that
   we started from originally.)  Since the order in which the items
   are stored in the tree is not related to the specified partial
   ordering, we may need to walk the tree several times before the
   loop has completely been constructed.  If the loop was found, the
   global variable LOOP will be NULL.  */
